# Noise Complaints Distribution in Manhattan
1. Most of the noise complaints come from the southern part of Manhattan; especailly, the south-west of Manhattan. From the noise complaints map that I made, the south-west of Manhattan is in darker color which means there are more complaints. Maybe there were a lot of constructions happening in the areas which caused the complaints. The map that I made about the descriptor for noise complaints roughly reveals the reason. There were a lot of construction noise in the southern Manhattan; however, the northern part of Manhattan has less construction noise but more Ice Cream Truck noise. 

2. The additional data that I collected about population by NTA further supports my opinions. The map of the population by NTA shows the fact that less people live in the southern Manhattan and more people stay in the northern Manhattan. By connecting this information with the noise complaints distribution, I assure that the south part of Manhattan create the most noise since nobody would like to live in a noisy place.
